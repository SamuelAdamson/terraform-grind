## Terraform Practice & Development

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) programming language maintained by HashiCorp. The language is used to provision resources across various public cloud platforms including AWS, GCP, and Azure.

<strong>This repository</strong> serves as a storage bucket for modules/workspaces I utilized whilst practcing for the Terraform Associate certificate. This is my first step towards specializing in cloud-based software engineering and cloud infrastructure engineering.

### Why cloud?
Cloud computing and the proliferation of public cloud technologies will enable the most impactful technologies in the years to come. As an example, in the early 2020's large language models (LLM's) such as GPT and Code Davinci developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) have taken the world by storm. 

Due to the large compute resources required by these models, the only practical way to deliver these technologies to businesses is through public cloud. 

In the coming decades, quantum computing will likely be delivered in a similar manner.
